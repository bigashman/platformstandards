## Conventions
You should be aware of RFC 2209 and how we use terminology like 'MUST', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY'

We have tried to conform to the Campaign for Plain English - this means that in exchange for easy to understand documentation we expect our readers to respect the intent of rules and not necessarily the letter of the rules.  Any clarifications can be made - issue a pull request or email me.
